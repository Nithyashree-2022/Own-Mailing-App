# Own-Mailing-App
Why use GMail when you can create your own mailing app using SMTP in Python!!!

I have created my own mail application named MyMail using Streamlit web app as follows:

The project uses Streamlit front-end which inputs the recipient's address(es),subject-line ,body of the mail and image attachments(if any) and mails just perfectly to the recipient(s).

Functionalities:

Mail both:

1.Text

2.Attachments(IMAGE FILES ONLY)

Test cases:

->1 recipient with no attachment(s) 

->1 recipient with attachment(s)

->multiple recipients without any attachment

->multiple recipients with attachments

The above can be successfully achieved with the given code-"Implementation of SMTP...."

MIMEMultipart is used to mail plain-text and image attachments.

NOTE:

List of recipients must be comma-separated ONLY
